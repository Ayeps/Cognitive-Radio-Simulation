# Cognitive-Radio-Simulation

## To Do
* Method for BTS to evaluate its used frequencies (scale down or up according to amount of users)
Evaluation done -> Do actual frequency reassignment part (methods acquire_more_spectrum() and decrease_own_spectrum())
* Turn based loop until every device votes to stop (votes taken again each round)

Base stations work toward better throughput in total and UEs work greedily to get best value for themselves.

## Soft To Do
* PEP8 everything [Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/])
* More informative plots, e.g. bts switch cost against gained throughput
