# Cognitive-Radio-Simulation

## To Do
* Method for UE to evaluate its position and desire to change BTS
* Method for BTS to evaluate its used frequencies (scale down or up according to amount of users)
* Turn based loop until converge

Base stations work toward better throughput in total and UEs work greedily to get best value for themselves.

## Soft To Do
* PEP8 everything [Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/])
* More informative plots, e.g. bts switch cost against gained throughput
